# Customer_Segmentation

Clustering problem

* Objective : Perform a market segmentation on a transactional dataset. Produce profiles for 5-7 customer segments.

* Dataset : A retail store's transactional dataset in a CSV format was used having around 1.5 million records and 6 features.

* Tools and Models Used : This project was completed using SQL and Python programming. The algorithm implemented in the project was K-means clustering.

* Feature Selection and Engineering: Generated and selected important features using the available data, which is useful for segregating the customers.

* Data Pre-processing : The data was checked for collinearity and dimensionality reduction technique called Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the number of features by eliminating correlated features. The values were pre-processed to change the skewed distribution of variables and make it more normal. Finally, the data was standardized to have equal importance of all features.

* Model Evaluation : The results of clustering were evaluated using Silhouette score and by visualizing the clusters on a scatter plot.

* Result : 5 clusters are created based on spending behaviour and their pen profiles are created. The segments were named as: Occaional Buyers, Convenience-seeker Buyers, Premium Buyers, Regular Buyers and Budget Buyers
